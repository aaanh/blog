Anh is a _very_ junior Software Developer in DevOps with a big passion for his crafts. But, he has received positive recognitions from his colleagues and supervisors as a highly skilled developer despite his still-growing experience in the field.

Anh steadily yearns to achieve professional maturity in DevOps, software development cycle, systems design and architecture, and site reliability engineering through continuous learning and continuous experimenting (CL/CE pipeline ðŸ˜‚). He frequently builds projects that utilize SotA and enterprise-grade frameworks to hone his skills.

In addition to his professional development, as an undergraduate student, Anh is keen on researching machine learning concepts in conjunction with the operational aspects (MLOps) and the service architectures (`{ML, DL, AI}aaS`). This is done through his participation in a growing research group at his current alma mater.
