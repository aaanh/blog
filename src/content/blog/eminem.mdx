My first exposure to rap was Eminem. My first exposure to Eminem was through the music video "I need a doctor", produced by Dr. Dre, on a US-UK pop music channel back in Vietnam in 2011. I can remember clearly that I came across the MV in the evening, after I had finished with my homework. The TV channel, darn I feel old, was shuffling new songs. I don't remember what came before or after "I need a doctor", but I know that the rest was history.

Back then, I was really into anything Anglophone cultural exports and more specifically the exports from the freedom state of 'Murica. The percussive rhythms of Em's rap in the first 2 verses and Doc's heavy impact lines in the last verse left a huge impression in the fragile and impressionable consciousness of the young me. I immediately looked up the song on YouTube and its lyrics to try and sing along, or more accurately, _rap_ along. And I have memorized the lyrics by heart ever since. Even 13 years later, I can still write it down verbatim, completely off the cuff.
