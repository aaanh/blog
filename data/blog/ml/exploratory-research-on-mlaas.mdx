## Background

Starting around end of May, I picked up a project pitch from my research professor. This "mini" project originally entailed benchmarking or finding a way to benchmark Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms. Some examples of these platforms were given: [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) by Amazon [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) by Google, [AzureML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) by Microsoft, [Watson](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio) by IBM. With those examples in mind, I began to survey the Platform-as-a-Service scenery in search for similar services.

## Expected Outcomes

We cannot really kick-start the research process without a certain goal in mind. Even though such goal might be vague, it still allows us to form a direction and enumerate the areas we want to look into.

For this project, my immediate goal is to gather as much information about these platforms as possible and form a report. My report would include the observed characteristics of the surveyed platforms and use
