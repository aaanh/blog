## Overview of Student Organization Structures

To assert a common descriptive language, a student org has the following executive hierarchy:

- President(s)
  - Vice Presidents (VPs)
    - Directors
      - Volunteers

Excluding the volunteers, these roles are referred to as **executives** or the **organizers** if the student org holds some kind of events.

More than one person can hold the role of **President**, depending on the scale and workload of the org, thus becoming Co-Presidents. The President usually confer their ideas, visions, requirements, and goals that the org would work to achieve.

Next we have the **Vice Presidents**, or VPs for short. VPs are cornerstone of whether or not the student org can maintain and grow itself and whether their event would be a success. VPs are experts in their area of operation and are the ones who will decide the specific strategies and plans to help their team succeed in whatever they do. As a VP, one must always stay on top of the latest and greatest mumbo jumbo in order to innovate the team's operational prowess and elevate the team's skillset.

Last but not least, the **Directors**. A team headed by a VP might or might not have directors. But for teams whose responsibilities cover a wide berth of subject matters or their day-to-day work requires a huge amount of commitment in terms of time and energy, directors are there to divide & conquer the tasks at hand.

## Areas of Expertise

Depending on what the org does and wants to achieve, there are teams which specialize in dealing with the specific task. Without going into anything too technical, normally, these are the core teams that an org would most likely have, note that each of the team is led by its respective VP:

- Internal (usually 1-man army)
- External (probably can be combined with Internal)
- Sponsors Relation
- Finance
- Marketing/Public Relation/Media Relation
- Logistics/Events
- Technology/IT

Then, there can be other specialized teams that cover a niche. As an jovial example, a student org about guns and weapons would have a team dedicated to Materials or Targeting Systems or UAV ðŸ¤·.

Okay, with that out of the way, now queue our protagonist...

I was surfing Facebook one night in 2014 after a long day at school and then extra evening classes when I came across a recruitment posting for a role in a student organization at my high school. Its name is loosely translated to English as 'The School Radio Station'.
