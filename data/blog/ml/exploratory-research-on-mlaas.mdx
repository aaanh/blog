Around the end of April 2022, I volunteered myself to begin a report on machine learning as a service, MLaaS, platforms. Initially, I was to evaluate Vertex AI from Google Cloud in terms of pricing and user experience. What I thought was a straightfoward test it and report it came out to be way more significant. As far as I can see, we cannot really evaluate a service without a baseline to compare the measurements. Even so, such measurements are practically non-existent.

Soon, I realize that we need a different approach, a standard, for our evaluations.
