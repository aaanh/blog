      <title>Almost Had to RMA My Spanking New MacBook</title>

      <description>But I managed to recover everyting in the end ðŸ˜‚</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; the curiosity finally killed the cat. Recently, I installed Asahi Linux on my M1 Pro Macbook â€” my mission critical daily carry system without a flipping care in the world. It worked surprisingly well, no problems whatsoever, but I found it to be not as useful as I would have imagined. The problem didn&amp;rsquo;t lie with the engineering or stability of the Asahi Linux project, but rather it lied with the general support for Linux systems on ARM chip, especially for Arch-based distributions. Everything was fine but because of the lack of feature support, 5 hours ago, I decided to nuke the dual boot partition and reclaim the disk space, then reinstall macOS altogether because the OS was running a bit slow and hotter than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without searching online beforehand, I did a full wipe of whatever partitions there were on the SSD. And that right there was the gateway drug down the rabbit hole of whatever the heck Apple was doing to configure their filesystem and disk management, with the sparkling cameos of useless answers on the Apple discussion forums by wannabe gurus and quantum pseudo tech literate self-acclaimed know-it-alls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal SSD of my MacBook before I solved the shenanigan, caused by blindly nuking the partitions is as followed: - disk0: 500GB â€” this is the physical disk total capacity - disk0s1: 500MB â€” GUID Partition Table - Free Space: 4xxGB â€” the weird-ass void - disk0s2: 2GB â€” the recovery partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I deleted both the macOS (~400GB) and Linux partitions (~100GB) with the command from the Terminal in Recovery boot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;diskutil eraseVolume free free disk0s#
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came across this erase command from an Asahi Linux stackoverflow post in which the OP also wanted to nuke the disk like myself. However, that was the end of the story on the post without the &amp;ldquo;what to do after you nuke&amp;rdquo; instructions. Well, I thought to myself, if there&amp;rsquo;s no sequel to this post, then the subsequent process should be easy enough. Aaaand, I was dead wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yeet of the SSD partitions leave behind the void which just could not be detected by the MacOS installer nor the graphical tool (diskutil). To make it detectable again, I had to do the most illogical thing which is expanding disk0s1 which was apparently the &amp;ldquo;GUID Partition Table&amp;rdquo;. It does not make sense because normally this partition just stores the partition table, not the whole usable partition space. But, before I came across this solution, I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;what the heck, last resort, last ditch effort before I need to send in the laptop for RMA anyway.&amp;rdquo; Turns out, Apple&amp;rsquo;s ways of performing seemingly regular processes are &lt;em&gt;built different&lt;/em&gt;, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note before I end this blog, I have already tried wiping ALL partitions but they are all locked by kernel (process 0). Heck, I even tried killing the kernel ðŸ¤ª process that&amp;rsquo;s using the partitions. In my defense, I was booting from a USB so killing the kernel on the internal SSD is justifiable course of action, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after expanding that GUID partition, the installation can be continued normally without any further hiccup. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stray away from experimental software for now ðŸ˜… as this problem took a huge chunk of my time for troubleshooting&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m officially done with Windows 11</title>
      <link>https://blog.aaanh.com/posts/windows-11-beta-postmortum/</link>

      <description>Oh god, please no, stop.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;After more than a month of usage, I have now wiped my Windows 11 boot drive and reinstall a fresh copy of Windows 10. Here is my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the beginning of August when people were freaking out about the purportedly leaked Windows 11 super secret alpha/beta, I managed to get into the Windows Insider program, configured my desktop to match the specs requirements (TPM and secure boot), and upgraded to Windows 11. My first impressions of Windows 11 are mostly positive: it has nice eye-candies, revamped system UI and dialogs, and a genuinely smooth and fast experience without too many bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I opened a can of worms&amp;hellip; Windows 11 is littered with anti-consumer tactics designed to lock the user into the shitty first-party software offerings from Microsoft. I am looking at Edge. Although Edge has gone Chromium for a while and might be even better than Chrome in terms of performance. I&#39;m giving quite a big benefit of the doubt here. However, that is not my qualm with Edge, it is the hinderance of free choice, or plainly lack thereof. The evil big corporation has struck end-users once again. Changing default programs is now done at the protocol/file type granularity, one is no longer able to change the default programs for a set of functions (e.g. web browsing, music player, etc.) with just one click (or 3-4 clicks in the Windows 10 case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be cherry-picking this particular fault. But after using Windows 11 extensively for various tasks and workflows, the default program was the tipping point. Prior to that, there had been already many stupid UX decisions. Perhaps one of the more noticeably annoying change is the simplification of the right-click context menu. Want to extract with 7z? At least 3 clicks. Want to do anything that is not copy-paste or whatever the basic functions are? At least 2 clicks, and I am being generous here. Other than requiring more energy and time to perform an action, such design inhibits one&amp;rsquo;s performance in their workflow, (in)effectively increases the time during which the user is being yanked out of the thought context in order to extraneous auxiliary steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the Settings app. God why? I&amp;rsquo;ll now have to use God Mode, launch .cpl and .msc via Win + R, GPO, and regedit to modify configurations that are now completely hidden out of plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion, while Windows 11 mgiht be a cute little face-lift for the now aging Windows 10, it also robs users of their productivity by oversimplifying and overcomplicating certain aspects the interface into a dumbed-down fiasco of rigid proprietary piece of software gore to make their shareholders happy campers. At this rate, when the number of users starts to dwindle because of the illogical business decisions, will they able to keep the shareholders which they hold so up high on the greedy pedestal?&lt;/p&gt;
