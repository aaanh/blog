# Something-as-a-Service

In modern days, we have a lot of `*aaS`, or Something-as-a-Service... services that are offered to the users and customers on the platform of the service provider. Depending on the its type, a service may provide from low- to high-level resources. The more mechanisms and aspects that are abstracted from the user, the more high level it is. However, we should not use such high-level-ness measure to compare between different services. Rather, it is simply a way to put the service into the perspective of manageability.

Another key attribute of `*aaS` is that you will have to pay for it recurrently based on a myriad of usage types. For example, IT as a Service may charge you per number of endpoints and users in your organizations or Games as a Service may charge players monthly for access to one AAA game (a la World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy) and its server or for playing games streamed through a browser (a la Google Stadia, Nvidia GeForce Now).

See the list below for a good list of examples, adapted from Wikipedia. Note that our MLaaS (and also DLaaS) fits snugly under the umbrella of AIaaS.
